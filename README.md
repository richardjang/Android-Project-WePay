# Android-Project-WePay
The purpose of our application is to make payment tracking in large groups much simpler by allowing users to collaborate through a single application. By doing this, we take the stress out of calculating each individualâ€™s debt. Example: A person who is hosting an event can open a tab and invite others into this tab. The host can then put in the total expenditure which would be split between the entire group. When the amount of money is finalized, the host can then send a request which would equally divide out the costs and request it from each user in the tab.
